# exercism-haskell
my elaborate jokes

My solutions to the exercism-haskell problems.

Note: I already sorta know Haskell, but since my job is mainly writing about Haskell, I often felt like I was going too long without writing code. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to forget how. I felt like doing the exercism problems could help me bridge those gaps and write more Haskell, even if it's often not super interesting Haskell. However, since I do already sorta know Haskell, the ways I go about solving these problems are not usually the simplest or more obvious. Sometimes they are such overkill for the given problem that one of the exercism mentors asked me if my solution was meant to be "an elaborate joke" -- and, maybe! Maybe we should write more elaborate joke programs and enjoy ourselves!

But I just wanted to put this here in case you are new to Haskell and wondering if what I wrote is the simplest (or most idiomatic, or most correct, or what have you) way to solve the problem; the answer is "probably not." However, they do work, and maybe you'll enjoy finding different ways of solving them, even if they're weird.
